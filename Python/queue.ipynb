    "Decoupling: Queues decouple the production of frames (e.g., reading from a video file) from their consumption (e.g., processing). This allows the producer and consumer to work at their own pace, preventing one from blocking the other.\n",

    "Buffering: Queues provide a buffer between different stages of processing. This buffer can help smooth out variations in processing time and handle bursts of data more effectively. For example, if the processing of frames takes longer than reading them, the queue can temporarily store frames until they can be processed.\n",
